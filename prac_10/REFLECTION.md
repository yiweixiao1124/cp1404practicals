# Reflection
## Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
My accuracy wasn't very high, but now my code accuracy is higher than last semester.
## Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
I can learn different solutions from other people's code through coding review. I'm also more familiar with coding.
## Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
I would introduce some group work so that students would learn how to work as a team before joining in work.
